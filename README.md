Each folder corresponds to a section or project from the course, containing Jupyter notebooks and datasets for practice.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ngoc-minh-do/Py_DS_ML_Bootcamp.git
   cd Py_DS_ML_Bootcamp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for managing Python packages and environments.
   - Create a new environment and install Jupyter and required libraries:
     ```sh
     conda create -n dsml_bootcamp python=3.8
     conda activate dsml_bootcamp
     conda install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly cufflinks nltk
     ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open any notebook and start learning!**
